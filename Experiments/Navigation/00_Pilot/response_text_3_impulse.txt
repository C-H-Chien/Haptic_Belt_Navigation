Strategy Used: At the start of each trial, I would rotate my body until the vibration was centralized on the center of my stomach. Then I tried to follow that direction by walking straight.
Vibration change: On some trials I noticed the change in vibration. It did help me feel more confident as I got very close. However, I think the center of my stomach became desensitived to the vibrations over the course of the experiment, and so I don't notice the change as much.
Other Observations: I closed my eyes for most of the trials in the last block
