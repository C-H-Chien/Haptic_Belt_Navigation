Strategy Used: Turning until the vibrations were felt on my navel and using that to guide whether or not to walk straight.
Vibration change: I noticed that the vibrations got more continuous instead of discrete as I approached the goal. It was slightly helpful, but I had been already desensitized to the vibrations so it was not that helpful.
Other Observations: No.
