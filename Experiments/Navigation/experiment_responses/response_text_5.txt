Strategy Used: I tried to center myself first before walking towards my goal so I wouldn't need to make a lot of adjustments. E.g. if i feel the initial vibrations behind me, I will turn 180 till i feel the vibrations infront of me.
Vibration change: Yes, the vibrations felt faster as I got closer. Yes, this helped me slow down so I don't move past the goal. There were times where I moved too fast past the goal but the vibrations helped me recenter myself to get to the point.
Other Observations: There were a couple times where I would see the blue and red cylinders but then they would disappear for a moment before reappearing again.
