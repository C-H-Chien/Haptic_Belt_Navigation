Strategy Used: i noticed that the closer i got, the faster the vibrations became, so it signaled to me that i was close to the reaching the goal spot.
Vibration change: 
Other Observations: i feel like the vibrations directed forwards seemed light? it was easy to tell when to go right or left or to turn around; however, going forward felt difficult at times? i wasn't sure if i was drifting off course
