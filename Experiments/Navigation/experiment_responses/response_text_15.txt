Strategy Used: I would try to center the vibration on the front of my body. If the vibration was on my back, I pivoted around so I could walk forward rather than backwards. It would feel awkward to walk backwards and I walk a lot faster when I go forwards. After I centered the vibration to the front of my body, I quickly moved straight and adjusted if I veered off course
Vibration change: I could feel the vibrations getting stronger when I was getting closer to the goal. When I was walking forward quickly, I used the more intense vibrations to slow down so I didn't walk into a wall. It was a good indicator that I was closer to the goal. Otherwise, I think I would be more lost when I'm searching for the goal. I don't know how I would describe "efficiently" in this case, but it did definitely support me when searching for the goal based on the reasons I gave above
Other Observations: When the blue/red poles were resetting, it threw me off a little bit because sometimes there would be a small period of them generating. I am not sure what the cause of that is, but sometimes I was just standing around waiting for the poles to generate. I was worried about hitting a wall during the experiment, but honestly it turned out okay. I felt more confident walking faster as I continued with the experiment. I would be interested to see how I do with the green poles visible again and having the vibrations and whether that would be faster than me not seeing them. I can't entirely compare those two phases well because I was less confident in walking at the start. This was a cool experiment. Thank you! :)
