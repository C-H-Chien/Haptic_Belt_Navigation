Strategy Used: I kind of just hoped for the best, and tried to sidle methodically as long as I felt the vibration in the right place.
Vibration change: I noticed a cascade of vibrations as I got near but not on a goal--as I made my way around it I could feel the vibrations going around the belt
Other Observations: It made me think about low-vision pedestrians on crowded streets--vibrations near intersections, etc.
