Strategy Used: first i line my body like a compass facing the target before walking. then i adjust if needed while moving towards the target.
Vibration change: vibrations got faster when i closed in but it didnt help much because i felt more comfortable moving slowly with the stable pattern. (but if i try to speedrun the experiment maybe the faster vibrations when i close in towards the target can help more)
Other Observations: i felt the vibrations more on the anterior than the posterior side of my body.
