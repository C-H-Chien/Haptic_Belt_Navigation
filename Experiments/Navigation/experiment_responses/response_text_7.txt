Strategy Used: I just followed how the vibrations indicated me to move. First I began by locating which side the vibration was and then moved towards it.
Vibration change: Yes. the vibrations got stronger and more frequent as the goal got closer.
Other Observations: The blue pole disappeared few times as I was walking towards it. Rest was okay.
