Strategy Used: I scanned my surroundings constantly and used the vibration band to understand where exactly it wanted me to go.
Vibration change: Yes, the change in pattern and intensity of vibrations helped me understand where exactly the goal positions where as I approached it.
Other Observations: It was at times difficult to tell if it was pointing me to let's say North and North East. But as I moved it was clearer to tell.
