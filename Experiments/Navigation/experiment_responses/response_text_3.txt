Strategy Used: I tried to turn as accurately as possible at the very beginning of each goal. That way, I didn't have to adjust too much after I started walking. I did not walk before turning. This felt like the best way to use the vibrations.
Vibration change: I did notice a change in the vibrations, and it did help me to know when a goal was getting closer. I still felt like there were a few times that I didn't respond fast enough and may have stepped over the green goal. At first, even though the change in vibrations helped, I also noticed I was very hesitant. That hesitation went away as I got more used to using the vibrations to navigate.
Other Observations: I noticed that it was much easier to navigate to the back directions using the vibrations. I could turn immediately to start walking towards the goal. I did not have to search around as I did when I only used sight to navigate. There were also times that I overshot the goal by a little bit and then had to navigate back. I noticed when I overshot it because I would go from feeling the front vibrate to feeling the front-left or front-right vibrate.
