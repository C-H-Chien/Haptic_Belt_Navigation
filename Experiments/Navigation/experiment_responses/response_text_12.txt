Strategy Used: Sometimes I oriented my body towards vibration to bring vibrations to navel. However rarely I also walked backwards, but never side wards
Vibration change: I did not notice a huge change. Maybe it was there and it helped me too but I do'nt think it was that huge.
Other Observations: The vibration on front (navel) are strong compared to back. Or maybe back skin is hard to feel vibration.
