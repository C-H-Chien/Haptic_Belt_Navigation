Strategy Used: I always let the front middle one towards to the goal so it felt the strongest.
Vibration change: Yes, it became more "random" since one step I could already walk past the goal. I am not sure whether it is a good thing or not.
Other Observations: I noticed that sometimes when I stood on the blue one and looked at the red one, it is not always reacted quickly.
