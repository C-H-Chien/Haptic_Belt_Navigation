Strategy Used: no, I just went with the vibration, I didn't have other strategies
Vibration change: yes, because when getting closer to the goal, the vibration becomes more intense, and then I know I was about to get to the goal
Other Observations: there is one spot where the red and blue poles are not shown correctly, sometimes they disappeared, and I had to walk around so they would come back. Also, sometimes I see the brick walls but I think I wasn't even close to the actual wall.
