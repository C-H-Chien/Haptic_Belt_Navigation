Strategy Used: Just focusing on the vibration itself to guide my direction of walking.
Vibration change: Not really, it felt pretty much the same except for when I reasch the target it virbates all over my waist.
Other Observations: It gets harder when the visual cues are gone and relying completely on the vibrations was pretty difficult.
