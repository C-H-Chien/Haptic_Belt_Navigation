Strategy Used: 1. I generally aligned my body center with the vibration. 2. If I feel a sudden shift of vibration from forward to the side, I know the object is nearby, so I just stopped and turned. 3. I partially relied on the sound of the vibration, which probably is due to adaptation to the experiment
Vibration change: I had the suspicion of it but it was not clearly registered in my cognition. My actual body response could tell a different story though.
Other Observations: 1. Toward the end, the navel vibrator does not feel like as strong. 2. The target feels like moving some time. 3. I put the score of the fourth question as 6 because of the navel one is not very clear toward the end
